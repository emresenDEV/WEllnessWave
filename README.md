### Hackathon Objectives:

##### Prompt: "Develop a digital wellness hub for college students"

###### **Challenge:**

In a span of about than 4 hours, create a simple digital solution to enhance mental wellness among college students. Your solution should address two or more of the following aspects:

* ** Stress Reduction Tool: **
  * Develop a feature or tool that helps students manage and reduce stress levels. This could be a feature that guides users through calming activities.
* ** Peer Support Platform: **
  * Build a platform that facilitates peer support among college students. You can include features for anonymous sharing, supportive communities, and resources for managing academic stress.
* ** Daily Mindfulness Reminder: **
  * Create a tool that sends daily reminders to practice mindfulness. This could include short mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, or positive affirmations.
* ** Study Break Gamification: **
  * Develop a gamified solution that encourages students to take regular breaks during study sessions.
* ** Mental Health Resource Locator: **
  * Build a tool that provides easy access to mental health resources available on college campuses or online. You can include information about counseling services, support groups, and relevant helplines.

###### Solution:

Our team found that while McNeese University offers plenty of wellness and mental health services, they are scattered and can be difficult to find-this leads to many missed events and a lack of awareness from students. Our solution was a wellness hub which was designed based on the current resource offered by McNeese University (a single webpage with a few links and events). 

Our solution welcomed users with a [guide to stress reduction](https://sites.google.com/view/wellnesswave/home?authuser=0) and led users through several resources to achieve reduced stress. 

Our Stress Reduction tools and Study Break Gamification can be found [HERE](https://sites.google.com/view/wellnesswave/stress-reduction?authuser=0).

We also designed a [peer-support platform](https://sites.google.com/view/wellnesswave/peer-support?authuser=0) where students can seek help from other peers directly or anonymously. Students will also find access to the Tutoring Center here. 

As listed above, there are a lot of events going on and the university lacks a centrally located hub which lists all of them. Our concept has a [Google Calendar](https://sites.google.com/view/wellnesswave/events?authuser=0) (which could be subscribed to by end-users for seamless event updates), access to the current McNeese student portal, what to expect at said McNeese events, upcoming events, along with an option to engage and involve students via suggesting events. There is also a section for all of the various campus-related social media accounts. 

Students comes from various walks of life and everyone manages their stressors differently. It's important to have a [centrally located resource locator](https://sites.google.com/view/wellnesswave/student-resources?authuser=0) to take the mental load away from finding help. WEllnessWave offers students the resources to find in-person help, virtual help, and to join a community. There is no need to suffer in silence at McNeese University.
